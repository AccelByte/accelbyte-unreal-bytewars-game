# Byte Wars - Unreal Engine

## Overview

Byte Wars is the official tutorial game for AccelByte Gaming Services (AGS). It is intended to act as a sample project that can be used as a reference on the best practices to integrate our services into your game. We created Byte Wars from scratch as a fully functional offline game. This offline game was then brought online with the power of AccelByteâ€™s platform by adding different services from each of our service areas like access, play and engagement. Every tutorial module walks you through a step by step guide to add a specific feature to Byte Wars which you can then translate into your own game.
