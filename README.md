# Byte Wars - Unreal Engine

## Overview

Byte Wars is the official tutorial game for AccelByte Gaming Services (AGS). It is intended to act as a sample project that can be used as a reference on the best practices to integrate our services into your game. We created Byte Wars from scratch as a fully functional offline game. This offline game was then brought online with the power of AccelByteâ€™s platform by adding different services from each of our service areas like access, play and engagement. Every tutorial module walks you through a step by step guide to add a specific feature to Byte Wars which you can then translate into your own game.

## Prerequisites

* Use **Unreal Engine** version 5.1.0 source build from [Unreal Engine on Github](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue-on-github).

## Branches

Byte Wars published the source code in two branches:
* **main branch** is the vanila version game source code without any submodule and will in use for [Tutorial Module: Initial Setup](https://docs.accelbyte.io/gaming-services/tutorials/byte-wars/unreal-engine/learning-modules/general/module-initial-setup/).
* **tutorialmodules branch** is the branch that has the AccelByte's Plugins and all the Byte Wars tutorial modules with feature flag.
