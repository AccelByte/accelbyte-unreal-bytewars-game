# Byte Wars AMS - Unreal Engine

## Overview

Byte Wars AMS is the official tutorial game for AccelByte Multiplayer Servers (AMS). It is intended to act as a sample project that can be used as a reference on the best practices to integrate our services into your game. We created Byte Wars from scratch as a fully functional offline game. This offline game was then brought online with the power of AccelByteâ€™s platform by adding different services from each of our service areas like access, play and engagement. Every tutorial module walks you through a step by step guide to add a specific feature to Byte Wars which you can then translate into your own game.

This version of Byte Wars, act as a sample project for AccelByte Multiplayer Servers (AMS) without AccelByte Gaming Services (AGS). This is intended for developer who want to use AMS with other services. In this sample, we are using a sample matchmaking service that can be run locally alongside Byte Wars.
